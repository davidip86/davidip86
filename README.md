Currently I'm part way through a full time data analytics course with a training provider, Albany Beck which follows a data science bootcamp I completed with HyperionDev in the first half of 2023. I have a bachelors degree in Mathematics & Physics and have previously worked as an adviser in the fiancial services industry.

  - Industry concepts, practices, terminology (e.g. Agile, SDLC, Git, Datalakes etc)
  - SQL (concepts such as relational databases, normalisation. Hands on utlisation - creating/defining table     and relationships, manipulating data etc)
  - Power BI (importing, cleaning and transforming datasets, calculations, filtering, creating dashboards,       visualisations and forecasting.



ðŸŒ± The bootcamp with HyperionDev was based on coding in Python. Topics covered in the bootcamp included:
  - Data types and handling methods
  - Control structures and Loops
  - Programming operators
  - Lists & dictionaries
  - Functions
