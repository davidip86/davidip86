### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I live in London and am looking for an entry level job in data science having completed a data science bootcamp with HyperionDev in 2023. I have a bachelors degree in Mathematics & Physics and currently work in the financial services industry.

  - Data types and handling methods
  - Control structures and Loops
  - Programming operators
  - Lists & dictionaries
  - Functions
  - Dataset handling
  - Data analysis
  - Data visualisation
  - Machine learning
  - Pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn, spaCy
